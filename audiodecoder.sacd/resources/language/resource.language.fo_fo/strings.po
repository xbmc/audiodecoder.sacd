msgctxt "Addon Description"
msgid "This addon allows Kodi to read content from a Super Audio CD ISO image.

Super Audio CD (SACD) is a read-only optical disc format for audio storage, introduced in 1999, developed jointly by Sony and Philips Electronics to be the successor to the Compact Disc.

The SACD format offers more audio channels (e.g. surround sound), a higher bit rate, and longer playing time than a conventional CD."

#[Consistency] Make terms, settings names, brands and other minutiae, consistent throughout file.
#[Capitalization] Avoid capitalizing every second word. See http://grammarist.com/capitalization/
#For example, prefer wording as "This new string" instead of "This New String".
#[Referencing] If a suitable string already exists, reuse it, making a note of where it's used!
#[Description / location] For example, "#. Description of some setting" used on "#: xbmc/addons/guidialogaddoninfo.cpp"
#When writing a description or setting, refer to a setting name in quotes. See existing entries for guidance.
#For example, "Press \"OK\" for \"All seasons\"" instead of "Press OK for All seasons" after first word.
