# [Consistency] Make terms, settings names, brands and other minutiae, consistent throughout file.
# [Capitalization] Avoid capitalizing every second word. See http://grammarist.com/capitalization/
# For example, prefer wording as "This new string" instead of "This New String".
# [Referencing] If a suitable string already exists, reuse it, making a note of where it's used!

# When writing a description or setting, refer to a setting name in quotes. See existing entries for guidance.
# For example, "Press \"OK\" for \"All seasons\"" instead of "Press OK for All seasons" after first word.
